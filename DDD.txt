DDD = Domain Driven Design
-> way of building software:
   -where you focus on the real-world problem (domian)
 
-> Think of it like this: 
   you are building an app like bank, you first ask: 
	1- what does your bank do?
	2- what is an account?
	3- what is the transaction?
	4- what are the rules for transferring money?
domain concepts == Account, Transaction

Now:
Domian = the subject area or the problem we're solving
Driven = your software based on domain, not a random code idea (now you don't just make a "USER SERVICE" you desgin based on real banking needs)
Design = How you structure your code? -to match the domain concepts 

In General:
لو عملنا بلاتفورم تحفه واحنا عارفين انها تحفه ولما طلعت للنور كانت تحفه هيفضل القرار الاول والاخير انها تحفه لليوزر اللي هيستخدمها عشان كدا
